1. Introduction

fuseflt is a FUSE filesystem that allows the user to define file conversion
filters that will be applied when requested. It relies on filename extensions
to determine file types.



2. Platforms

Currently only the following platforms are supported:

* Linux 2.6.x

It may work on other platforms with a FUSE port. You need the libcfg+ library,
which can be found at http://platon.sk/projects/libcfg+/.



3. Setup

3.1. Compilation

First of all you need the libcfg+ library (http://platon.sk/projects/libcfg+/).
Afterwards, a simple call to `make' is normally all you will need to compile
fuseflt:

$ make

You can override the CFLAGS variable to provide optimisation flags e.t.c. The
DEBUG variable can be used to enable debugging - if you are using gcc, setting
DEBUG to "-g" would probably do.


3.2. Installation

First verify with `make -n install' the installation paths. By default, the 
installation prefix is /usr/local and the fuseflt binary is installed in 
$(prefix)/bin. You can set the prefix and bindir variables to override these
defaults. Then run `make install' as root to perform the actual installation:

# make install


3.3. Configuration

The configuration resides in a plain text file, which is parsed using the
libcfg+ library. It contains variables in the following form:

<variable> = <value>

The supported variables are:

cache_chk_int: an integer that indicates the number of seconds to elapse before
	each cache entry expiry check. It can be specified only once.

cache_max_age: an integer that indicates the maximum allowed age of a cache
	entry in seconds, after which the entry is removed. It can be specified
	only once.

ext_in: along with a corresponding ext_out variable, it creates a filename
	filter, where filenames that end in the string supplied in ext_in will
	be changed to end in the one supplied in ext_out instead. Both variables
	are strings and can be left empty if needed. Each ext_in should have
	_exactly_ one corresponding ext_out entry. Multiple ext_in/ext_out sets
	can be used to specify multiple filename filters.

ext_out: see ext_in above.

flt_cmd: a filter shell command. It is parsed using /bin/sh -c, so mind your
	quotation.
flt_in: the input file extension for this filter.
flt_out: the output file extension for this filter.

All three flt_* entries are required to set a file conversion filter. Multiple
flt_* sets can be used to create multiple filters.


3.3.1. Extension filter example

Suppose that you already have a filter that decompresses .gz files, and you want
to use it transparently. All you have to do is add the following to your fuseflt
configuration:

ext_in	= .gz
ext_out	=

Each *.gz file will have the .gz suffix removed and then the empty string added,
essentially stripping the .gz extension.


3.3.2. File conversion filter example

Suppose that you want to convert all bzip2-compressed files to gzip-compressed
ones. The following should do:

flt_in	= .bz2
flt_out	= .gz
flt_cmd	= bzip2 -dc | gzip -9c

A usage example:

$ ls
a.bz2 b.bz2
$ zcat a.gz
A A A A A
$ zcat b.gz
B B B B B

You may add the following in your configuration:

ext_in	= .bz2
ext_out	= .gz

to be more transparent about the whole process:

$ ls
a.gz b.gz


3.4. Running

Please read the FUSE documentation before using fuseflt.

Run `fuseflt -h' to see the various command line options. You need a prepared
configuration file beforehand and an existing mountpoint. Then all you have to
do in most cases is:

$ fuseflt file.conf source_directory/ mountpoint/


4. Internals

Some people say the most accurate documentation is the source code itself, no?
