* Why this FUSE module ?

Because I wanted to compress several hundred megabytes of documentation on my
system, but Apache can't serve bzip2-compressed files and my installed version
of Moziila can't read compressed .html files at all. Oh, and lynx breaks when
the cross-file links are not updated with the compressed filenames...

So I needed something to transparently uncompress files and possibly perform
other processing as well, like converting PDF files to plain text. I decided to
built a generic FUSE module that will convert file contents as needed, based on
a configuration file.


* What about other modules ?

I had a look at the following:

- fuse.gunzip:
    pros: er... it works? at least that's what the author says. I never actually
	tried it. It apparently performs extensive caching.
    cons: it requires the source directory to be prepared with a custom utility,
	that, among other things, messes up the reported source file sizes. It
	only supports a gzip-based compression.

- yacufs/convertfs:
    pros: caching, support for user-defined filters.
    cons: requires a cache directory, the filters are defined in the command
	line, rather than in a configuration file.


* What does the name mean ?

FUSE FiLTer. Not very imaginative, I know...


* Does it work ?

Some minimal testing revealed no problems. I am planning to use it extensively
for my documentation directories, so it will receive a lot more testing.


* How does it work ?

To find out read the `Internals' section in the README. Then read the source 
code itself for details.


* I found a bug !

Good! Now report it at <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>... or even better fix it and 
send a patch!


* How can I help ?

- Test it.
- Report any bugs.
- Ideas, suggestions e.t.c. are welcome. Patches even more!
- Occasionally you may drop a line to say that it worked for you. Positive
  feedback is just as important.


* I don't like your coding style

I don't like yours either.


* Who wrote it ?

Me, Theodoros Kalamatianos, a student at the department of Electric and Computer 
Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. For purposes related 
to fuseflt I may be reached at <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>.


* Under what license is it released ?

Naturally, the GNU General Public License. The full text of the GPL is included 
in the fuseflt tarball.
