Sat May  5 15:37:56 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.4
	* Fixed broken caching code which used to cache all file descriptors,
	  rather than just the ones corresponding to conversion filter output.
	  fuseflt won't reach the open fd limit so fast now.
	* Added a cache size limit and a pruning function. fuseflt should now be
	  far more robust when cache entries accumulate way too fast (like when
	  users dare try absurd and completely illogical things such as running
	  `find' or even `ls -l' on a large directory. Running `ls'... what are
	  people thinking these days?)

Sat May  5 01:30:00 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.3
	* A new command line syntax was added, so that fuseflt can be used from
	  /etc/fstab.

Fri May  4 14:18:44 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.2
	* Sending SIGUSR1 to fuseflt will now clear the cache, freeing all
	  file descriptors.
	* The temporary file directory is now settable from the configuration
	  file.
	* Minor documentation updates
