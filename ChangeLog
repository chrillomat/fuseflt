Tue May  8 01:56:28 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.7
	* Moved the creation of the cache expiry thread to the new flt_init
	  function, so that it actually works when fuseflt is not used with
	  the -f/-d options. That was a rather embarassing bug, to tell the
	  truth. It's what you usually get for not reading all the available
	  documentation... and it's also a proof that testing in controlled
	  conditions cannot compare to real-life tests.

Sun May  6 00:35:17 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.6
	* Fixed the getattr method to report correct information for converted
	  files.
	* The stat(2) information is now cached for converted files - a welcome
	  side-effect of the getattr fix.
	* Minor documentation updates

Sat May  5 21:00:26 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.5
	* Added the ability to use visible temporary files, as a way to avoid
	  the file descriptor usage limits. As a side-effect, if fuseflt is shot
	  in the head (kill -9, SIGSEGV and similar) the temporary files will
	  have to be removed manually. This mode has to be explicitly enabled in
	  the configuration file.
	* Ran fuseflt under valgrind and eliminated most memory leaks.
	* Minor documentation updates

Sat May  5 15:37:56 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.4
	* Fixed broken caching code which used to cache all file descriptors,
	  rather than just the ones corresponding to conversion filter output.
	  fuseflt won't reach the open fd limit so fast now.
	* Added a cache size limit and a pruning function. fuseflt should now be
	  far more robust when cache entries accumulate way too fast (like when
	  users dare try absurd and completely illogical things such as running
	  `find' or even `ls -l' on a large directory. Running `ls'... what are
	  people thinking these days?)

Sat May  5 01:30:00 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.3
	* A new command line syntax was added, so that fuseflt can be used from
	  /etc/fstab.

Fri May  4 14:18:44 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Release 0.0.2
	* Sending SIGUSR1 to fuseflt will now clear the cache, freeing all
	  file descriptors.
	* The temporary file directory is now settable from the configuration
	  file.
	* Minor documentation updates

Fri May  4 00:06:51 EEST 2007 - Theodoros V. Kalamatianos <nyb@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Initial testing release (0.0.1)
