0.0.4:
	* Fixed broken caching code which used to cache all file descriptors,
	  rather than just the ones corresponding to conversion filter output.
	  fuseflt won't reach the open fd limit so fast now.
	* Added a cache size limit and a pruning function. fuseflt should now be
	  far more robust when cache entries accumulate way too fast (like when
	  users dare try absurd and completely illogical things such as running
	  `find' or even `ls -l' on a large directory. Running `ls'... what are
	  people thinking these days?)
