0.0.5:
	* Added the ability to use visible temporary files, as a way to avoid
	  the file descriptor usage limits. As a side-effect, if fuseflt is shot
	  in the head (kill -9, SIGSEGV and similar) the temporary files will
	  have to be removed manually. This mode has to be explicitly enabled in
	  the configuration file.
	* Ran fuseflt under valgrind and eliminated most memory leaks.
	* Minor documentation updates
