0.0.9:
	* Document the proper mount options when used from /etc/fstab
	* Fixed the path resolution code so that existent files are never
	  overriden, even if they cannot be stat()'ed.
	* Skip filter entries with empty command strings
	* Fix the getattr() method so that it reports symlinks correctly. This
	  fixes a serious issue where `find' was unable to detect symlink loops.
	* Optimise getattr() so that it does not call open() any more.
	  This should also allow unreadable files to be stat()'ed.
	* Fix several error code paths in fdc_open()
	* Various other bug-fixes
	* Code clean-ups
	* Minor documentation updates
