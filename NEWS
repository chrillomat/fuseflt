0.0.8:
	* Fixed a nasty bug in the extension filtering code, where some strings
	  were being picked from the wrong array. That's what you get when you
	  code at 3am. The good news is that it should be OK now. The bad news
	  is that
	  a. the example config file allowed this to slip through unnoticed
	     (ouch, that was _bad_ luck)
	  b. no one reported the problem. Really, aren't there any people out
	     there using fuseflt?
	* Whitespace clean-ups
