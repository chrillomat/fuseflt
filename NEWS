0.0.7:
	* Moved the creation of the cache expiry thread to the new flt_init
	  function, so that it actually works when fuseflt is not used with
	  the -f/-d options. That was a rather embarassing bug, to tell the
	  truth. It's what you usually get for not reading all the available
	  documentation... and it's also a proof that testing in controlled
	  conditions cannot compare to real-life tests.
